🔐 Linux Security Monitoring & Networking Lab
📌 Overview

This lab demonstrates hands-on experience with Linux system administration, security monitoring, and basic network traffic analysis using an Ubuntu virtual machine in VirtualBox.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Ubuntu Linux (VirtualBox)

Bash

systemd / journalctl

auth.log / syslog

Wireshark

TCP/IP fundamentals

🎯 Objectives

Understand Linux logging and auditing

Monitor authentication and system events

Capture and analyse network traffic

Apply least-privilege principles

🛠 Key Tasks Performed

Installed and configured Linux VM with Guest Additions

Explored system logs using journalctl, /var/log/auth.log, and /var/log/syslog

Analysed login attempts and user activity

Installed and configured Wireshark for packet capture

Captured and filtered network traffic (DNS, HTTP, TCP)

Investigated packet metadata to identify protocols and endpoints

🔍 Security Concepts Applied

Principle of least privilege

Log-based detection

Network visibility

Basic threat surface awareness

📈 Outcome

Improved understanding of how Linux systems log activity and how network traffic can be inspected to support security monitoring and incident investigation.
