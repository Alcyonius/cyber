Network Traffic Analysis Lab - Ubuntu Linux:
Overview:
This lab demonstrates practical network traffic capture and analysis in a Linux environment using tcpdump and Wireshark. The objective was to collect real network traffic, analyse common protocols, and apply SOC-style investigation techniques to understand baseline network behaviour.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment:
Host Platform: VirtualBox
Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
Tools Used:
tcpdump
Wireshark
Network Configuration: NAT (isolated virtual network)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
Capture live network traffic in a Linux environment
Analyse packet data using Wireshark
Identify common network protocols and traffic patterns
Apply baseline analysis techniques used in Security Operations Centres (SOC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Methodology:
An Ubuntu virtual machine was deployed and updated to the latest packages.
Network traffic was captured using tcpdump with the following command:
sudo tcpdump -i any -w lab_capture.pcap
While capturing traffic, the following activities were performed to generate network data:
DNS queries using nslookup
ICMP traffic using ping
Web browsing over HTTP and HTTPS
The capture was stopped and saved as a PCAP file.
The PCAP file was analysed using Wireshark with protocol-based filters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis & Findings:
DNS Traffic:
Observed DNS query and response traffic for common domains.
Identified source and destination IP addresses and response timing.
Confirmed normal resolution behaviour without anomalous patterns.
ICMP Traffic:
Captured ICMP echo requests and replies generated by ping.
Verified packet sequencing and round-trip behaviour.
HTTP vs HTTPS:
HTTP traffic was observed in plaintext, allowing inspection of request headers and URLs.
HTTPS traffic was encrypted, demonstrating the importance of TLS for confidentiality.
Followed TCP stream:s to observe application-layer data where applicable.
TCP Conversations:
Used Wireshark’s conversation statistics to identify communication pairs.
Analysed data flow direction and packet counts to establish baseline behaviour.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
This lab successfully demonstrated the ability to capture and analyse network traffic in a Linux environment using industry-standard tools. 
The analysis provided insight into common protocols, encryption differences, and baseline network behaviour. 
These skills align directly with entry-level SOC and cybersecurity analyst responsibilities, including traffic inspection, incident triage, and network investigation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills Demonstrated:
Linux system usage and command-line tools
Network traffic capture with tcpdump
PCAP analysis using Wireshark
Protocol identification (DNS, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP)
SOC-style baseline network analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Steps:
Analyse suspicious DNS patterns and beaconing behaviour.
Capture and investigate failed authentication attempts.
Perform comparative analysis of benign vs malicious traffic.
